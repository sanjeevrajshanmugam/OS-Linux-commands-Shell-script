Instructions in Computer Architecture

Instructions are the fundamental units of operation in computer architecture, providing the necessary commands for a CPU to perform various tasks. Each instruction specifies an operation to be performed along with the operands on which the operation acts. Instructions can be categorized based on their addressing modes, operations, and the types of operands they handle.
1. Addressing Modes

Addressing modes determine how the operand for an instruction is specified. Different addressing modes provide flexibility and efficiency in accessing data.
Types of Addressing Modes

    Immediate Addressing Mode
        The operand is directly specified in the instruction.
        Example: ADD R1, #5 (Add immediate value 5 to register R1)

    Direct (Absolute) Addressing Mode
        The address of the operand is given explicitly in the instruction.
        Example: LOAD R1, 1000 (Load the value from memory address 1000 into register R1)

    Indirect Addressing Mode
        The address of the operand is specified by a pointer contained in a register or memory location.
        Example: LOAD R1, (R2) (Load the value from the memory address stored in register R2 into R1)

    Register Addressing Mode
        The operand is located in a register, and the register number is specified in the instruction.
        Example: ADD R1, R2 (Add the contents of register R2 to register R1)

    Register Indirect Addressing Mode
        The address of the operand is in a register, and the register is specified in the instruction.
        Example: LOAD R1, (R2) (Load the value from the memory address in R2 into R1)

    Indexed Addressing Mode
        The address of the operand is determined by adding a constant value to the contents of a register.
        Example: LOAD R1, 1000(R2) (Load the value from the memory address 1000 + the contents of R2 into R1)

    Base-Register Addressing Mode
        Similar to indexed addressing, but the base address is specified in a register.
        Example: LOAD R1, (R2 + 1000) (Load the value from the memory address in R2 plus an offset of 1000 into R1)

    Relative Addressing Mode
        The operand address is determined by adding an offset to the current instruction address.
        Example: JUMP 100 (Jump to the instruction 100 bytes ahead of the current instruction)

    Stack Addressing Mode
        Operands are implied to be on the stack, using the stack pointer.
        Example: PUSH R1 (Push the contents of register R1 onto the stack)

2. Operations

Operations define the action that the CPU performs on the operands. Instructions typically belong to one of several categories of operations.
Categories of Operations

    Data Transfer Instructions
        Move data between registers, memory, and I/O devices.
        Example: MOV, LOAD, STORE

    Arithmetic Instructions
        Perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
        Example: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV

    Logical Instructions
        Perform bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
        Example: AND, OR, XOR, NOT

    Control Transfer Instructions
        Change the sequence of execution by branching or jumping to different instructions.
        Example: JUMP, CALL, RETURN

    Comparison Instructions
        Compare values and set flags based on the comparison results.
        Example: CMP, TEST

    Shift and Rotate Instructions
        Shift or rotate bits in a register or memory location.
        Example: SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR

    Input/Output Instructions
        Transfer data between the CPU and peripheral devices.
        Example: IN, OUT

3. Operands

Operands are the data on which operations are performed. They can be of different types depending on the instruction and the addressing mode used.
Types of Operands

    Immediate Operand
        A constant value specified directly in the instruction.
        Example: ADD R1, #10

    Register Operand
        The data is located in a register.
        Example: MOV R1, R2

    Memory Operand
        The data is located in a memory location.
        Example: LOAD R1, 1000

    I/O Operand
        The data is located in an I/O device.
        Example: IN R1, 5

    Stack Operand
        The data is located on the stack.
        Example: POP R1

Example Instructions

Let's look at some example instructions combining addressing modes, operations, and operands:

    Immediate Addressing Mode with Arithmetic Operation
        ADD R1, #5
            Operation: Addition
            Operands: Register R1 and immediate value 5

    Direct Addressing Mode with Data Transfer Operation
        LOAD R1, 1000
            Operation: Load
            Operands: Register R1 and memory address 1000

    Register Indirect Addressing Mode with Logical Operation
        AND R1, (R2)
            Operation: Bitwise AND
            Operands: Register R1 and the value at the memory address contained in register R2

    Relative Addressing Mode with Control Transfer Operation
        JUMP 100
            Operation: Jump
            Operand: Offset value 100 (relative to the current instruction address)

    Write Back: The CPU writes the result back to the destination (register, memory, or I/O).

Conclusion

Instructions are the building blocks of a CPU's functionality, with each instruction specifying an operation and the operands involved. Addressing modes provide flexibility in specifying the operands, while the types of operations and operands determine the CPU's capabilities. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing efficient computer systems and optimizing software performance.

Restoring Division Algorithm

The Restoring Division algorithm is a binary division technique. Here are the steps to divide 12101210​ by 310310​ using the Restoring Division algorithm:
Convert to Binary

    1210=110021210​=11002​
    310=112310​=112​

Initialize Registers

    Dividend AA = 1100 (12 in binary)
    Divisor MM = 0011 (3 in binary)
    Register QQ initially contains the dividend AA.
    Register AA (Accumulator) initially set to 0.
    Length of QQ and MM is 4 bits.

Algorithm Steps

    Shift AA and QQ left by 1 bit.
    Subtract MM from AA.
    If A≥0A≥0, set the least significant bit of QQ to 1. Otherwise, restore AA (add MM back) and set the least significant bit of QQ to 0.

Step-by-Step Process:

Initial State:

    A=0000A=0000
    Q=1100Q=1100
    M=0011M=0011

    Shift AA and QQ left:
        A=0000→00001A=0000→00001
        Q=1100→1000Q=1100→1000
    Subtract MM from AA:
        A=0001−0011=1101A=0001−0011=1101 (in 2's complement: -3)
    Since A<0A<0, restore AA and set Q0Q0​ to 0:
        A=1101+0011=0001A=1101+0011=0001
        Q=1000→1000Q=1000→1000

        A=0001→00101A=0001→00101
        Q=1000→0000Q=1000→0000
    Subtract MM from AA:
        A=0011−0011=0000A=0011−0011=0000
    Since A≥0A≥0, set Q0Q0​ to 1:
        Q=0000→0001Q=0000→0001

Non-Restoring Division Algorithm

The Non-Restoring Division algorithm is another binary division technique, differing slightly from the Restoring Division algorithm.
Algorithm Steps

    Shift AA and QQ left by 1 bit.
    If the previous value of AA was non-negative, subtract MM from AA; otherwise, add MM to AA.
    Set the least significant bit of QQ based on the new value of AA (1 if A≥0A≥0, 0 otherwise).
    If after the final shift, A<0A<0, add MM to AA.

Step-by-Step Process:

Initial State:

    A=0000A=0000
    Q=1100Q=1100
    M=0011M=0011

    Since A<0A<0, add MM to AA:
        A=1011+0011=1110A=1011+0011=1110 (in 2's complement: -2)
    Set Q0Q0​ to 0:
        Q=0000→0000Q=0000→0000

Iteration 3:

    Shift AA and QQ left:
        A=1110→11000A=1110→11000

    Set Q0Q0​ to 0:
        Q=0010→0010Q=0010→0010

Final Adjustment:
Since A<0A<0 after the last iteration, add MM to AA:

    A=1101+0011=0000A=1101+0011=0000

Pipelined Hazards

Pipelined hazards, also known as pipeline hazards or simply hazards, are situations that prevent the next instruction in the instruction pipeline from executing during its designated clock cycle. These hazards can cause the pipeline to stall, leading to delays and reduced performance. There are three main types of pipeline hazards:

    Structural Hazards
    Data Hazards
    Control Hazards

Let's delve into each type, along with examples and possible solutions:
1. Structural Hazards

Definition: Structural hazards occur when two or more instructions require the same hardware resource at the same time. This conflict arises due to insufficient resources within the CPU.

Example: Consider a situation where an instruction fetch and a memory load instruction both need to access the memory simultaneously.

Solutions:

    Resource Duplication: Add more hardware resources. For example, having separate instruction and data memory (Harvard architecture) can eliminate conflicts between instruction fetch and data access.
    Pipeline Stalling: Stall one of the instructions until the resource is available. This introduces wait cycles and reduces performance but ensures correctness.
    Pipeline Interleaving: Design the pipeline so that different stages use different resources at different times, minimizing conflicts.

2. Data Hazards

Definition: Data hazards occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that has not yet completed its execution.

Types of Data Hazards:

    Read After Write (RAW) Hazard: Occurs when an instruction needs to read a location that a previous instruction is writing to but the write hasn’t occurred yet.
        Example:

        assembly

    ADD R1, R2, R3  // R1 = R2 + R3
    SUB R4, R1, R5  // R4 = R1 - R5

    Here, the second instruction needs the value of R1 which is produced by the first instruction.
    Solution:
        Forwarding/Bypassing: Use intermediate results directly from the pipeline without waiting for them to be written to the register file.
        Pipeline Stall: Delay the dependent instruction until the data is available.
        Reordering Instructions: Rearrange instructions to minimize stalls.

Write After Write (WAW) Hazard: Occurs when two instructions write to the same location in an order that does not match the program order.

    Example:

    assembly

    MUL R1, R2, R3  // R1 = R2 * R3
    ADD R1, R4, R5  // R1 = R4 + R5

    Here, the result of the ADD instruction should be written after the MUL instruction.
    Solution:
        Reordering Instructions: Rearrange instructions to avoid conflicts.
        Register Renaming: Use different registers for the results to avoid conflicts.

Write After Read (WAR) Hazard: Occurs when an instruction writes to a location that a previous instruction is reading from, but the read has not yet occurred.

    Example:

    assembly

        MOV R1, R2  // R1 = R2
        ADD R2, R3, R4  // R2 = R3 + R4

        If the ADD instruction writes to R2 before the MOV instruction reads it, a hazard occurs.
        Solution:
            Register Renaming: Use different registers for the operations.
            Reordering Instructions: Rearrange instructions to avoid conflicts.

3. Control Hazards

Definition: Control hazards occur due to the pipelining of branch instructions. When the pipeline makes wrong decisions on branch prediction, it needs to discard or flush instructions that were fetched or executed incorrectly.

Example:

assembly

BEQ R1, R2, LABEL  // Branch if R1 equals R2
ADD R3, R4, R5     // This instruction depends on the branch

If the branch is taken, the ADD instruction should not execute. If the branch is not taken, it should.

Solutions:

    Branch Prediction: Use algorithms to predict the outcome of branches and prefetch accordingly. When correct, this minimizes stalls.
    Delayed Branch: Delay the execution of the branch instruction to allow some instructions to execute regardless of the branch outcome.
    Pipeline Flushing: Flush the pipeline when a branch is mispredicted, discarding instructions that were fetched based on incorrect predictions.
    Branch Target Buffer (BTB): Cache the destinations of recent branches to quickly determine where to fetch the next instruction.

By implementing these solutions, the negative impacts of pipeline hazards can be mitigated, leading to more efficient execution of instructions in a pipelined architecture.

Multithreading is a technique used in processors to execute multiple threads concurrently, improving the utilization of CPU resources and overall system performance. There are four principal approaches to multithreading:

    Fine-Grained Multithreading
    Coarse-Grained Multithreading
    Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)
    Chip Multiprocessing (CMP)

1. Fine-Grained Multithreading

Definition: Fine-grained multithreading switches between threads on each CPU cycle. This approach helps to hide the latency of memory operations by executing other threads while one thread is waiting for memory access.

Diagram:

  | Thread 1   T1      T1      T1      T1
  | Thread 2     T2      T2      T2      T2
  | Thread 3        T3      T3      T3      T3
  | Thread 4           T4      T4      T4      T4
  +-----------------------------------------------
    Cycle     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

Explanation:

    Each cycle, the CPU switches to a different thread.
    This rapid switching reduces idle time but requires hardware support to manage the thread context switches efficiently.

2. Coarse-Grained Multithreading

Definition: Coarse-grained multithreading switches between threads only when a thread encounters a long-latency operation, such as a memory access. This approach reduces the overhead of context switching but doesn't hide short-latency operations.

Diagram:

mathematica

  | Thread 2                    T2  T2  T2  T2  T2  T2
  | Thread 3                                      T3  T3  T3  T3  T3  T3
  +-----------------------------------------------------------
    Cycle     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

Explanation:

    The CPU continues executing the same thread until a long-latency event occurs.
    The thread switch happens less frequently compared to fine-grained multithreading.

3. Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)

Definition: Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), also known as Hyper-Threading (in Intel processors), allows multiple threads to be executed simultaneously within a single CPU core. It utilizes the core's resources more efficiently by executing instructions from different threads in the same cycle.

Diagram:

|  +---+  +---+  +---+ |
+----------------------+
|   Memory Access      |
+----------------------+
|   Write Back         |
+----------------------+

Explanation:

    Multiple threads share the core's resources like the fetch, decode, and execution units.
    In each cycle, instructions from different threads can be executed, maximizing resource usage.

4. Chip Multiprocessing (CMP)

Definition: Chip Multiprocessing (CMP), also known as multi-core processors, integrates multiple processor cores on a single chip. Each core can execute threads independently, providing true parallelism.

Diagram:

| | +------+ |  | +------+ |
| | | T7   | |  | | T8   | |
| | +------+ |  | +------+ |
| +----------+  +---------+
+-------------------------+

Explanation:

    Each core operates independently and can execute multiple threads, providing high levels of parallelism.
    This approach scales well with increasing numbers of cores and can handle a large number of threads.



A Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller is a hardware component that allows peripherals to transfer data directly to and from memory without CPU intervention. This facilitates faster data transfer and frees the CPU to perform other tasks. Here, we'll provide a block diagram of a typical DMA controller and explain its components and operation in detail.

Components of the DMA Controller

    Control Unit: Manages the operation of the DMA controller. It interprets commands from the CPU and orchestrates the data transfer between the memory and peripherals.

    Address Register: Stores the starting address in memory where the data is to be read from or written to.

    Counter Register: Keeps track of the number of bytes (or words) to be transferred. It decrements with each byte (or word) transferred and indicates when the transfer is complete.

    Data Register/Buffer: Temporarily holds the data being transferred. This is used to buffer data between the memory and the peripheral during transfer.

    Status/Command Register: Holds status information about the DMA operation (e.g., whether the transfer is in progress, completed, or if there are errors) and receives commands from the CPU to start or stop the transfer.

    Peripheral Bus Interface: Connects the DMA controller to peripheral devices. It handles the communication between the peripheral and the DMA controller.

    Memory Bus Interface: Connects the DMA controller to the memory. It manages data transfers between the DMA controller and the system memory.

    System Bus Interface: Connects the DMA controller to the CPU and other system components, enabling it to communicate and control the data transfer process.

Operation of the DMA Controller

    Initialization:
        The CPU initializes the DMA controller by setting up the control, address, counter, and command registers with appropriate values. This includes specifying the source and destination addresses and the amount of data to be transferred.

    Request for DMA Transfer:
        When a peripheral device needs to transfer data to or from memory, it sends a DMA request (DRQ) signal to the DMA controller.

    DMA Acknowledgment:
        The DMA controller acknowledges the request with a DMA acknowledge (DACK) signal to the peripheral, indicating that it can proceed with the transfer.

    Bus Request and Grant:
        The DMA controller requests control of the system bus from the CPU by sending a bus request (BR) signal. The CPU grants control of the bus by sending a bus grant (BG) signal back to the DMA controller. Once the bus is granted, the CPU suspends its operations temporarily.

    Data Transfer:
        Read Cycle: The DMA controller reads data from the source (either a peripheral or memory) into its data register/buffer.
        Write Cycle: The DMA controller writes data from its data register/buffer to the destination (either memory or a peripheral).
        The address register is updated to point to the next memory location, and the counter register is decremented with each transfer until the count reaches zero.

    Completion:
        When the counter register reaches zero, indicating the transfer is complete, the DMA controller releases control of the bus back to the CPU and updates the status register to indicate completion.
        Optionally, the DMA controller can send an interrupt signal to the CPU to inform it that the transfer is complete, allowing the CPU to resume its operations with the new data.

Example Use Case

Consider a scenario where data from a hard disk needs to be transferred to RAM:

    Initialization: The CPU sets up the DMA controller with the starting memory address, the number of bytes to transfer, and the control signals.
    DMA Request: The hard disk controller sends a DMA request when it has data ready.
    DMA Acknowledgment: The DMA controller acknowledges the request and takes over the bus.
    Data Transfer: The DMA controller transfers data directly from the hard disk to the RAM.
    Completion: Upon completion, the DMA controller releases the bus and signals the CPU, which can then process the data in RAM.

This method significantly improves efficiency by reducing CPU involvement in the data transfer process and enabling faster data transfer rates.
